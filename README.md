# Ribbit Frog Software

Ribbit Network is a large network of open-source, low-cost, Greenhouse Gas (CO2 and hopefully other gasses in the future) Detection Sensors. These sensor units will be sold by the Ribbit Network and will upload their data to the cloud, creating the world's most complete Greenhouse Gas dataset.

This respository contains the software for the Frog Sensor.

## Current Software

The current Ribbit Network Frog software is being developed for the [Frog Sensor Version 4.](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-hardware)

## Getting Started / Dependencies

To get started, you'll need to install a few dependencies first.

### ESP IDF

We currently build and test with ESP-IDF v5.1.2.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/esp
cd ~/esp
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
git checkout v5.1.2
git submodule update --init --recursive
./install.sh all
```

## Building the Software

Fetch the submodules:

```shell
$ git submodule update --jobs 32 --init --recursive
```

Set up ESP-IDF:

```shell
$ source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

Run tests:

```shell
$ make test
```

Build the firmware:

```shell
$ make build
```

## Flash the ESP32

Connect the esp32 board to your computer using the USB-C connection port on the esp32 and a cable that will connect to your computer.

Press and hold the "boot" button then press the "reset" button and release both at the same time (shown below). This puts the esp32 into a flashing mode.

The device should now appear on your machine as a serial port like `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Now the command below can be run to flash the software to the device.

```shell
$ make DEVICE=/dev/ttyACM0 flash
```

## Background Information

[See the Wiki for background research.](https://ribbitnetwork.notion.site/Learnings-Low-cost-sensors-for-the-measurement-of-atmospheric-composition-e3d41736c49e41ad81dcdf7e16a6573b) This project is inspired by some awesome research by incredible scientists in academia.

## Ribbit Network

Ribbit Network is a non-profit (501c3) creating the world's largest Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset that will empower anyone to join in the work on climate and provide informed data for climate action. We're an all volunteer team building everything we do in the open-source community.

If you would like to consider sponsoring Ribbit Nework you can do [via this link](https://givebutter.com/ribbitnetwork). The money is used to pay for software fees, purchase R&D hardware and generally support the mission of Ribbit Network.
